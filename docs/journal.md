How the project got here, in order. What worked, what didn't, and why.

## 2026-10-31: the brief

Research into Freescape, Driller's versions and the BBC's fastest solid 3D
(`docs/research/`) led to `BRIEF.md`. Matt then asked for four colours to
be considered, then MODE 2 and ordered dithering, then "many colours and
as fast as you can make it", working autonomously with agents. That made
decision 2 (MODE 2, a 104 × 104 view at the ZX's geometry) and the design
in `docs/engine.md`.

## 2026-10-31: the screen and the frame loop (track A)

`build/freescape.ssd` boots on jsbeeb's Master into MODE 2 set in the
hardware, double-buffered in main and shadow RAM, with a test scene in
the view (`docs/engine.md`, section 1, "as built"). Measured that day
with `make frames` (jsbeeb's full video, 10s a run):

- The test scene writes its whole view a frame. It runs at 24.97 frames
  a second, every frame shown for 2 fields. Each frame spends 55,769
  cycles between `frame_begin` and `frame_end` and 20,520 waiting in
  `frame_begin`. That wait is what a renderer gains by putting its stages
  0-9 before `frame_begin`.
- With its cost varied at random, 322 frames in 502 fields were shown
  for 1, 2 or 3 fields (155, 152 and 14 frames). All 573 flips landed in
  the vertical blank, at least 30 lines before the next line shown. All
  2,317,952 screen writes went to the buffer not shown.
- The interrupt takes 80-109 cycles a field with no key held, and about
  1,000 while one is (the 28 keys read one at a time).
- `FS` is &371 bytes, the test scene about a third of it.
- MOS 3.20's MODE 2 puts the vertical sync at row 35 with `*TV 0,1`,
  where OS 1.20's table says 34. MOS 3.20 adds the `*TV` setting plus
  one, read from its ROM's table and the CRTC after `*TV 0`, `1` and
  `255`. The disc follows MOS 3.20.
- A soft BREAK while the disc runs puts IRQ1V back to MOS 3.20's and
  returns to BASIC in MODE 7, on jsbeeb.
- `make frames` was checked against deliberately broken copies, each of
  which it failed:
  - no wait in `frame_begin`;
  - the flip to the wrong buffer;
  - a flashing palette entry;
  - a key mapped wrong, or not read;
  - `frame_end` before the writes;
  - the view drawn a byte off;
  - R7 a row out, and interlace on;
  - interrupts held off for longer than the flip's window, and for
    longer than a field;
  - an interrupt longer than a field.

## 2026-10-31: the ZX oracle (track D)

Driller's ZX tape loads headless in SkoolKit's simulator, past its copy
protection and menu, to the main loop in play (`tools/zx.py --boot`).
The original's own redraw then draws any view (`--view AREA:ENTRANCE`),
and `make zxviews` draws all 65 entrance views into `build/zx/views/`.
`docs/research/zx-driller.md` has what it found, with addresses: a cell is
64 world units and the camera's position is the eye; the matrix is
`S · Rroll · Rpitch · Ryaw` in signed bytes, each step rounded; the
projection is `104 + 104·X/Z` across and `52 + 52·Y/Z` up, with `S`
giving both axes the same focal length; there's no near plane, only the
pyramid from the eye; and the sort is ScummVM's but with the area's
objects before the globals. `tools/zx_arith.py` copies the original's
maths, and its check calls the original's own routines on random inputs:
no case differed.

Measured that day (48K timing, with contention and the game's interrupt):
a redraw takes a median of 2,293,923 T-states (0.66s), from 670,879 to
4,273,507 over the 65 views. Projection is 63% of it, the sort 11% and
drawing 26%. The start view matches the frame the game drew at boot byte
for byte.

## 2026-10-31: the data and the Python model (track E)

`tools/freescape.py` reads Driller's database straight off the ZX tape
(`make data`, with its checks). `tools/model/` renders any view with the
6502's integer arithmetic (`docs/research/model.md` has the conventions),
with the maths, the rasteriser and writer, and the colours as stand-ins
until their tracks land (`tools/model/parts.py` switches).

Checked that day against the original (`make model-zx`, `make
model-check`):

- every entrance's camera lands where the game puts it;
- the objects drawn agree in 64 of the 65 views (area 27's entrance 22
  draws one extra sliver);
- 99.95% of pixels away from edges agree with the original's images;
- the projected vertices are within 13/16 of a pixel of a floating-point
  reference in the entrance views, and within 4 pixels over every yaw with
  pitch and roll, all of it from the byte matrix the original shares.

The work a view takes, over the 65 entrance views (median, 90th
percentile, maximum): objects drawn 10, 15, 19; vertices transformed 63,
92, 121; vertices projected 43, 70, 99; faces drawn 14, 25, 36;
face-lines 249, 521, 878; runs written 302, 495, 951; bytes where two
runs meet 94, 173, 424.
